# Sample Python code on implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset and reduce the number of dimensions while retaining as much of the original information as possible. In this example project, we'll demonstrate how to use PCA to analyze a dataset.
